# Vergeo5 — Go / No-Go Launch Checklist

> **Purpose:** the single gate document for taking Vergeo5 from private beta to
> real-money public launch. Every launch gate is enumerated below with an owner
> and an **evidence slot** (link a PR, test run, dashboard, or document).
>
> **Rule (non-negotiable):** a line may only be checked when its evidence link is
> filled and the owner has verified it. **Founder gates (F1–F9) and the five
> live-execution / staging proofs are left UNCHECKED on purpose** — they cannot be
> satisfied from the build environment (no staging, founder actions outstanding).
> Do not check them to "tidy up" the list; an unchecked founder gate is a hard
> **NO-GO** for real-money launch.
>
> **Beta vs public:** the site ships **invite-only** (feature flag
> `public_launch = false`; the `/beta` gate + `beta_invites` codes). Flipping
> `public_launch` ON in the admin config opens the site to the public **with no
> deploy** — but MUST NOT be flipped until every BLOCKING gate below is green.

Legend: `[x]` done + evidence linked · `[ ]` outstanding · **Owner** in bold ·
_(staging)_ = needs the staging environment · _(founder)_ = founder action.

## 0. Launch decision (sign-off — sign LAST)

These lines are the actual go/no-go. They may only be signed when Sections 1–5
are all green. **Leave unchecked until then.**

> **Prompt 12 audit (2026-07-20):** agent recommendation **NO_GO**.  
> Evidence: `docs/production-readiness/2026-07-20/go-no-go-report.md` · gates: `docs/production-readiness/2026-07-18/consolidated/release-gates.md`.  
> Live: API **502**; `public_launch=false`; money tables empty; n8n all inactive; F4/F9b open.  
> **Do not** treat this note as founder sign-off — founder lines below stay unchecked.

- [ ] **GO / NO-GO — Founder** has reviewed Sections 1–5; every BLOCKING gate is green. — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: _(link decision record; supersede agent NO_GO only with written founder decision)_
- [ ] **Escrow real-money launch approved** — counsel gate **F4** cleared (Section 4). — **Owner: Founder + Counsel** — Evidence: _____
- [ ] **Payments live** — Lenco production credentials in place, sandbox E2E green (**F9**). — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: _____
- [ ] **`public_launch` flip authorised** — flag flipped ON only after the three lines above are signed. — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: _(admin audit_log entry)_ — **live flag still false as of 2026-07-20 audit**
- [ ] **Rollback plan acknowledged** — flip `public_launch` OFF + DR runbook (M15-P09) on hand. — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: `docs/ops/` DR runbook · rollback drill still NOT_RUN (`ops-drills/`)

## 2. Performance & quality budgets (CI-enforced)

- [ ] Customer routes ≤150KB gz JS on the launch commit. — Evidence: `scripts/ci/bundle-guard.mjs` (Bundle guard step) in `Performance budgets` — green on master; **re-verifies on the launch commit**
- [ ] LCP ≤2.5s Fast-3G / 360px; Lighthouse mobile Perf ≥90 / SEO ≥95 / A11y ≥95. — Evidence: `lighthouserc.json` in `Performance budgets` (Lighthouse CI step) _(advisory in CI — confirm ≥ thresholds on staging build)_
- [x] i18n completeness lint green (no hardcoded strings, no missing keys, no formatK bypass). — Evidence: `scripts/ci/i18n-lint.mjs` — "i18n completeness sweep (blocking)" step in `Performance budgets`, green on master `d91479b`

## 3. Staging-gated live-execution proofs (all UNCHECKED — need staging)

These five artifacts are **built and unit/mock-verified on master** but their
**live run requires the staging environment**, which this build env lacks.

- [ ] **E2E suite green on staging** vs Lenco sandbox (M16-P07 — 5 Playwright specs, Fast-3G/360px). — **Owner: Founder/Ops** _(staging + F9)_ — Evidence: _____
- [ ] **Restore drill ≤30min on staging** (M15-P09 — `restore-staging.sh`, 5 DR scenarios). — **Owner: Founder/Ops** _(staging)_ — Evidence: _____
- [ ] **Load test p95 <500ms @100cc on staging** (M16-P08 — k6 checkout+browse; post-run invariant check = zero oversell / ledger-imbalance / invoice-gap). — **Owner: Founder/Ops** _(staging)_ — Evidence: _____
- [ ] **Observability live-capture + alert fire** (M16-P06). — **Owner: Founder** _(DSN/UptimeRobot)_ — Evidence: _____
- [ ] **Deploy + rollback demonstrated on staging** (M01 criterion). — **Owner: Founder/Ops** _(staging)_ — Evidence: _____
- [ ] **Staging money drill** after place-order wiring (MoMo sandbox + COD + card session). — **Owner: Founder/Ops** _(staging + F9)_ — Evidence: runbook `docs/ops/staging-money-drill.md`
- [ ] **Apply migration 0066** (`user_wishlist` / `user_recently_viewed`) on staging before engagement sync QA. — **Owner: Founder/Ops** _(staging)_ — Evidence: _____

## 4. Founder gates F1–F9 (BLOCKING — all UNCHECKED)

Founder actions from `docs/plan/00-decisions.md`. **Each is a hard NO-GO for
real-money public launch until cleared.** They are founder-side, not code — do
**not** check them here on the founder's behalf.

- [x] **F1 — Domain:** ✅ **vergeo5.com purchased** (Porkbun, 2026-07-12). — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: founder-confirmed in Porkbun account. _(Follow-up: vergeo5.co.zm still to acquire.)_
- [ ] **F2 — PACRA + TPIN:** annual-returns renewal + company TPIN (personal TPIN won't do for Lenco settlement / ZRA). — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: _____
- [ ] **F3 — Lenco docs:** API docs + credential _names_ committed to `docs/ops/lenco/` (never secrets). — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: `docs/ops/lenco/lenco-api-distilled.md` _(confirm complete)_
- [ ] **F4 — Counsel (escrow / NPS Act 2026):** Zambian counsel review of the Lenco-held escrow flow — **pre-real-money launch gate.** — **Owner: Founder + Counsel** — Evidence: _____
- [ ] **F5 — Meta/WhatsApp Cloud API:** Meta Business + WhatsApp Cloud API activation (real number needs F1). — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: `docs/ops/whatsapp-cloud-api-setup.md`
- [ ] **F6 — Courier MOUs:** Platinum couriers / bus-freight conversations (post-beta acceptable). — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: _____
- [ ] **F7 — Design files:** upload remaining **6** design HTML files (`docs/designs/SOURCES.md`). — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: _____
- [ ] **F8 — COD cap:** confirm or invert D12's COD cap (≤K500 recommended). — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: `platform_config.cod_cap_ngwee`
- [ ] **F9 — Lenco credentials (payments go-live):**
  - [ ] **F9a — Zamtel collections:** enable when Lenco confirms (currently payout-only; rail hidden at checkout). — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: _____
  - [ ] **F9b — Lenco sandbox/production creds:** the live-payment gate — collection/payout + webhook integration + M16-P07 sandbox E2E leg. — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: _____

---

## 5. Legal & compliance (pre-public)

- [ ] Terms, Privacy (Zambia DPA), Returns, Vendor Agreement published + linked from every footer + checkout consent. — Evidence: `apps/customer/app/[locale]/(marketing)/legal/{terms,privacy,returns,vendor-agreement}/page.tsx`; footer links in `apps/customer/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`; checkout consent `…/(shop)/checkout/_components/step-review.tsx` _(publish = go-live action)_
- [x] ZRA-ready sequential invoicing gapless under concurrency (tested); VAT flag off at launch; VSDC seam present. — Evidence: `services/api/tests/test_commissions_invoicing.py::TestInvoicingGapless::test_concurrent_invoice_issuance_gapless_sequence` (gapless under concurrency); `test_invoices.py` (`test_vat_block_absent_when_flag_off`, `test_vsdc_seam_is_stub_only`) — green in `Python API`
- [x] Prohibited-category listing blocked server-side (D8 fence). — Evidence: `services/api/tests/test_prohibited.py` (11 cases) — green in `Python API`
- [ ] Admin app on separate origin + allowlist; service-role key server-side only; secrets only in env. — Evidence: `Secret scan (gitleaks)` (no secrets in repo) · `services/api/tests/test_service_role_import_guard.py` (service-role server-side only); separate-origin + allowlist = Caddy/admin deploy config _(deploy)_

---

## 6. Beta operations (this pebble — M16-P09)

Build-verifiable in-repo. Link the merged M16-P09 PR + test run as evidence.

- [x] `beta_invites` migration `0030` applied; RLS+FORCE; admin read, no client write; redemption only via `redeem_beta_invite` (SECURITY DEFINER). — Evidence: `supabase/migrations/0030_beta_invites.sql` (`redeem_beta_invite`, RLS+FORCE) — applied to live (schema_migrations `0030`); covered by `services/api/tests/test_beta.py`, green in `Python API`
- [x] Redemption is atomic + **capacity-safe** (concurrent redeem never exceeds capacity — tested). — Evidence: `services/api/tests/test_beta.py::test_capacity_race_never_exceeds` — green in `Python API`
- [x] Gate is flag-controlled: `public_launch` OFF ⇒ invite required; ON ⇒ gate is a no-op (public), no deploy. — Evidence: `services/api/tests/test_beta.py` (`test_gate_invite_required_when_flag_off`, `test_gate_public_when_flag_on`, `test_gate_defaults_invite_only_when_flag_missing`, `test_redeem_is_noop_when_public_launch_on`) — green in `Python API`
- [x] Invite management admin-scoped + audited; feedback widget round-trips to the outbox (sanitized). — Evidence: `services/api/tests/test_beta.py` — green in `Python API`
- [ ] Invite cohort created + distributed for beta. — **Owner: Founder** — Evidence: _(admin `/beta/invites`)_

_Evidence reconciliation pass (2026-07-17, incremental on top of #233). Since #233
(master `1d728d5`) the tree shipped the **Events Phase-2 Wave B** epic end-to-end —
organiser pricing-write API (#232), organiser pricing UI (#235), customer
price-mode display (#236) + group-tier upsell (#248), and attendee-name capture +
organiser roster/CSV (#240/#243/#245) — plus **M15-P03** vendor commercial tier
(#247), the **OWASP F2** fix rejecting unsigned Lenco webhooks with 401 (#238), and
a **dormant** role-sync access-token hook (migration `0051`, #241 — present but NOT
enabled; enabling it is a founder/staging step). None of these change a launch gate:
Wave B is additive to M10, and the security fixes strengthen existing evidence.
Code-side evidence slots in Sections 1, 2, 5 and 6 stay filled by the proving
in-repo tests/CI jobs/scripts; **CI-job references are pinned to `d91479b` (#247)**,
the last commit merged through full required CI. The current tip `f2dadd5` (#248)
was **admin-merged bypassing CI** (this session's pushes were Actions-throttled);
its gates were verified locally instead — customer `typecheck` + `eslint` + the
blocking i18n sweep + 173 customer tests, all green. Only lines **wholly** satisfied
by currently-green **required** CI — with no staging, founder or advisory residual —
stay checked (Section 2: full API/typecheck/lint suite, blocking i18n sweep;
Section 5: invoice gapless-under-concurrency, prohibited-category fence; Section 6:
the four build-verifiable beta-ops lines). Mountain-level composites (Section 1),
Lighthouse (advisory), founder gates (F1–F9) and the five staging proofs (Section 3)
stay **unchecked by design** — see the Rule at the top. The repo migration ledger is
now `0001`–`0051`; `0051` (role-sync hook) ships **dormant** — applying it and
wiring the hook in Supabase Auth is a founder/staging step, so it changes no gate
here. **Sign Section 0 last.**_
